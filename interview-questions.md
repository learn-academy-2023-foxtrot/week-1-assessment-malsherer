# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a tool for source code management that allows coders to collaborate. Github is the website where the git tool can be stored and used.

Researched answer: Github is a hosting service that allows developers to store and make changes to code remotely, allowing collaboration. Git is also used for version control, which is a system that records the changes made to a file over time.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Conditionals will return Boolean values. Operators such as ===, !==, &&, and || make evaluations and return Boolean values.

Researched answer: Operators that return Boolean values are called logical operators.

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: The values within an array are the content of each item within an array. For example, given the array var californiaNwslClubs = ["Angel City FC", "San Diego Wave FC", "Bay FC"] the values within the array are the strings "Angel City FC", "San Diego Wave FC", and "Bay FC". The index shows the position of each item within an array starting at 0. In the array above, "Angel City FC" is at index 0, "San Diego Wave FC" is at index 1, and "Bay FC" is at index 2.

Researched answer: The values within an array can be accessed by their index number. Using my example above, running console.log(californiaNwslClubs[1]) would return the output "San Diego Wave FC"

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Strings values that are characters given in quotation marks, whereas arrays are lists of values contained in [] and seperated by commas. Strings can be given as values within an array.

Researched answer: String is a primitive data type. Arrays are variables that store data.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming uses to programmers to complete one project. The navigator gives instructions while the driver edits the project in real time. Best practice is to switch back and forth evenly.

Researched answer: Pair programming brings people with different strengths together on a project, as well as improving focus and increasing accountability.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A higher order function uses at least one function as an argument or returns a function as a result.

2. Jest: Jest is a testing framework for Javascript

3. Objects: Objects are collections of properties, named values, and methods.
